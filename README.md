# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose is to analyze the different UFO sightings using a dynamic table.

## Results: 
The user has the opportunity to use 5 different filters to analyze the available data. Each value must be typed in the same format as the placeholder, i.e. lowercase, country is abbreviated and date follows the #/#/#### format.

Once a value is entered, the user must press <strong>Enter</strong> in order to display the filtered data. The user can enter as many as 5 values (1 per filter) to get more specific data.

## Summary:

2. The table changes as a value is being entered
